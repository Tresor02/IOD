      "Now, the kid was a bit of a \"kuat mengadu\" sprinkled with a girl who cried wolf kind of vibe but honestly? saying that you're gonna rape a person is tasteless. Things happened and I ask all of them to stand outside the class as a punishment, one of the kid (A) suddenly got angry and decided to throw stuff out of rage.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was talking to a cleaner and a colleague today and the issue was brought up. The cleaner asked A and he said \"the usual, Z is mengadu about stuff that isn't there.\" And she laughed. I told them that kind of saying is mean and shouldn't be done and the act of throwing stuff out of rage is also bad. \n",
      "\n",
      "The concensus from both of them was the rape thingy was just a joke, teenagers at their neighborhood like to joke about that. No harm no foul. And they backed Z up from throwing stuff bc he is just 'a kid with a temper'. Finally, A shouldn't escalate stuff since it's just a joke and ridiculed A.\n",

      "\n",
      "Judge Wan Mohd Norisham Wan Yaakob ordered consultant Ong Su Ping Serene, 56, and businesswoman Sang Yoke Leng, 53, to enter their defence after ruling that the prosecution had succeeded in establishing a prima facie case against them at the end of the prosecution’s case.\n",
      "\n",
      "The judge said there was evidence showing the victim had been exploited by the two women, who were also violent against the victim.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The court found that the victim agreed to work as a maid but not to be used as a ‘punching bag’,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the judge’s ruling, it was revealed that Ong had brought the victim to her residence under the pretence of employment as a maid. During the victim’s testimony, she recounted a series of disturbing incidents, including being coerced into consuming rice with chillies, being subjected to humiliating exercises while unclothed, being prohibited from closing the bathroom door while bathing, being made to eat from a dog bowl, and enduring physical assault and threats.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The second accused (Sang) witnessed the violent act by the first accused but did not stop it; instead, she struck the victim,” he said, adding that the maid was not taken to a clinic for treatment other than being given salt water to gargle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wan Mohd Norisham said the victim, in her testimony, also stated that she was also locked up and threatened by the two accused, as well as forbidden to meet and talk to anyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also cited testimony by a neighbour, who is a prosecution witness, of hearing a person crying at night until early morning before receiving a note from the victim stating that she was depressed and threatened. The maid was rescued on Dec 20, 2014.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeking justice: Meriance seen at Ampang Sessions Court in Kuala Lumpur.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The witness stated that she was shocked on seeing the victim’s swollen face,” said the judge, adding that an expert witness stated that the injuries to the victim were the result of her being beaten and kicked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The court also found that the victim worked for long hours without enough rest, never took a holiday, was not free to move around, and was always in fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two women are charged with trafficking Meriance Kabu, then 32 years old, for exploitation as a maid in a house at Persiaran Pandan 7, Pandan Jaya, here between April and Dec 20, 2014. If found guilty, they could potentially face a 20-year prison sentence and a fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "They also faced charges for hiring an individual without a valid work permit at the same location and time. If convicted, they face a fine of up to RM50,000 or a maximum of 12 months imprisonment, or both.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, the court acquitted Ong on two counts of causing serious injury and attempted murder on Meriance, finding that the prosecution failed to establish a prima facie case against her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ong was charged with intentionally causing serious injury to Meriance by pulling out four of her teeth using pliers at the same location between April 11 and Dec 20, 2014.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was also charged with attempting to kill Meriance at the same place at 6pm on Dec 20 of the same year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deputy public prosecutor Anisah Pisol appeared for the prosecution, while lawyer S. Preakas represented Ong and Sang.\n",

      "Comment Body: Despite being only about a year older than Reddit, Facebook had the advantage of exponential growth in the mid-late 2000's back when it was still considered 'cool' - because it basically served a means of friends connecting with each other online (as opposed to the relative anonymity and heavier discussions on Reddit). This meant a lot of school-leavers, university students, etc. had a new platform to connect with and stay updated on their peers as they (physically) parted ways. Plenty of time to build habitual usage over the years\n",
      "\n",
      " There's also been an influx of late adopters in recent years (think Gen X and Baby Boomers) who came onto the platform after a while of seeing their kids on it to connect with their own friends. As you can imagine, there's generally (but not always) poorer media and Internet literacy amongst this generation, which has allowed low-effort/bot/AI-generated content and the like to thrive. These days, depending on where you look on FB, it's also become a bit of a hotbed for the conservative/racist/ultra-nationalist types to go largely unchecked - and I mean this for any race.\n",

Say what you will of the people in the various Malaysian subreddits, but there's still a lot more left-wing politics and (pseudo)intellectual discourse than, say, the Malaysian diaspora on Facebook. Also being more heavily text-based probably contributes to this, because it seems a lot of people aren't big on reading. \n",

      "Reddit has probably seen exponential growth in Malaysia in recent years, though. I blame the trashy clickbaity content farms (you know the ones) whose underpaid 'journalists' have turned to Reddit to steal/source their content, so you eventually see a certain segment of users from these sites, certain forums and the unfortunate usual Facebook types nowadays trickling in.\n",

They have a system where they run through your i/c to find all latest and relevant information about you. Ah Longs work together with other Ah Longs and these syndicates have investigative teams. Losing these Ah Longs won’t be easy as you think. If you borrowed a small amount and have the means to pay, clear the debt as soon as you can.

      "Comment Body: Special cases like this are held once a month if not mistaken where representative from the uni has to physically go to appeal with documentation and proof of student progression and plans. It all boils down to whether any valid reasons are given and if the requested period is feasible to complete (eg uni may request for half year to finish off remaining units or something along those lines). In cases where its like you still have an entire years worth of courses yet to take and already have prior extensions/problems (eg attendance records are poor, overall gpa/wam is below average etc) where it will be rejected and student will be sent back thus forfeiting any work already accomplished. If final face-to-face appeal is rejected then there is usually no other option (short of anything involving court case but thats a losing pathway to follow)\n",

Personal anecdote, I have a few acquaintances who ended up becoming ah longs (typical when you grew up in klang). There was one guy who attempted the same thing. Borrowed money, ignored calls and messages, deleted his socials, ran all the way to Miri in the middle of nowhere to hide. Took them no time to find him. Of course they were pissed off. Found him, brought him to some jungle, beat him up and increased the amount he had to pay back. Showed him photos of his parents house as blackmail if he ever tried to run away. Of course I don’t condone any of this but this is just the way they work. Don’t underestimate them. They often are tied to triads as well so you wouldn’t want to mess around and find out the hard way.\n",

On those warning it warned that it is not suitable for pregnant women. But when you sell it as ice cream, there are no labels or health warning for you to know that. That is where the problem starts. People buying and eating food mixed with medicine without knowing the consequences. Some OTC medicine even have warning like not suitable for people who taking anti coagulant medication.
